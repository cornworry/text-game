Frames
    Frames are the scenes of the game. Each frame should start end end with a delineation, something like a top and bottom border. A frame is made up of many details.
        - Things that might take up a whole frame:
            - Examination of a room, ending when the user takes an action that changes it's nature.
            - Listing all character attributes as in the `me?` command.
            - The help page.

Details
    Details are individual sentences or pieces of a scene. A frame contains many details. Details might include:
        - A question
        - A message about the current scene
        - An answer to a query such as examine, or search
        - A `repeat?` command

    - contains a message
    - maybe something about formatting?
